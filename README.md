# MLP-Mixer
Tensorflow/Keras implementation of the paper "MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision"

My implementation of the paper [MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601) (tolstikhin et.al., 2021). It introduces a complete Computer Vision architecture based only on MLP(Multi Layer Percepetron).

Model was trained for only 30 epochs for restricted computational resources on CIFAR-10 dataset. It achived an accuracy of 78.94% on training data and 70.15% on test data.
